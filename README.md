# NYC Schools
A project exploring the relationship between SAT scores and demographics in NYC. In this project, I use pandas, numpy, and regular expressions to read in and clean survey data regarding the SAT. I attempt to find whether or not there is a correlation between demographic factors like race, age, income, and gender with SAT scores to determine if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups perform better on the SAT, then we have some evidence that the test may be unfair. 

Quick observations
![SAT Scores and Race Correlation](https://github.com/fvu958/NYC_Schools/blob/master/graphs/sat_score_race_corr.png)
- White and Asian students correlate positively with SAT scores. Conversely, black and Hispanic students at schools correlates negatively with SAT scores. This may be due to socioeconomic factors, poverty, less support, and more

- A lower Hispanic student body correlates positively with higher SAT scores



Potential Next Steps:
- Determing wheter there's a correlation between class size and SAT scores
- Figuring out which neighborhoods have the best schools
- If we combine this information with a dataset containing property values, we could find the least expensive neighborhoods that have good schools.
- Investigating the differences between parent, teacher, and student responses to surveys.
- Assigning scores to schools based on sat_score and other attributes.
