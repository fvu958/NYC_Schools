# NYC Schools
A project exploring the relationship between SAT scores and demographics in NYC. In this project, I use pandas, numpy, and regular expressions to read in and clean survey data regarding the SAT. I attempt to find whether or not there is a correlation between demographic factors like race, age, income, and gender with SAT scores to determine if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups perform better on the SAT, then we have some evidence that the test may be unfair.
